# Real-estate-price-prediction-using-machine-learning-

This project abstract outlines a novel approach for establishing more reasonable price values for real estate using machine learning prediction mechanism.We can create the model with the help of linear regression algorithm and pandas , Sklearn and seaborn module to predict the price of the real estate properties and get patent of the technology.
Experiment with regression models such as Linear Regression. Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.

Assess the model's performance on a test dataset using various evaluation metrics. Visualize the predicted vs. actual prices to understand the model's accuracy.
